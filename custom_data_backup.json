      "description": "I grew up in a small town, shaped by the simplicity of village life and later exposed to the fast pace of cities and global cultures. That contrast taught me to stay grounded, observe closely, and value different ways of living and thinking. I studied computer science and built my career across product design and management ‚Äî now leading as an AVP of Product. I've always been curious, honest, and transparent, and I care deeply about how people experience technology in everyday life. No matter where work takes me, I carry the values and clarity that come from my roots.",

Rahul joined the company as a product designer, but with his hunger for knowledge and ambition, it was no surprise that he quickly rose to the position of Product Manager.\n\nAs one of the early employees, Rahul played a vital role in the company's growth. His good product acumen and eye for detail were instrumental in bringing to life many of the products that are now the backbone of Halodoc. He worked tirelessly to ensure that every product was not only well-designed but also user-friendly and met the needs of the customers. \nRahul is a true asset to any organisation. He is a strategic thinker, has a strong work ethic, and is always willing to go above and beyond to get the job done. He combines his technical expertise with his passion for understanding customers to create products that are both innovative and impactful. I highly recommend him for any product management role, and I am confident that he will continue to make a positive impact wherever he goes.",
